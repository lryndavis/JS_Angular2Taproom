Epicodus Javascript Week 2 / Angular2

Tap Room is an app rendered in Angular2 that allows a fictitious bar to keep track of their kegs. As a bartender (user), you can add new kegs with information about their brands, prices, and alcohol content. The user can also "sell" pints at the click of a button, and decrease the keg amount by 1. An alert is displayed when the amount in a keg drops below a certain number.
